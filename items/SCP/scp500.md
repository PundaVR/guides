### Gameplay:

**Detailed Description:**
Extremely useful, but limited. The panacea is faster and more efficient than the medkit.

SCP-500 fully heals the user and applies a substantial regenerative buff similar to the adrenaline. Additionally, it cures most debuffs and is quicker to use. It can be used by pressing left click with the item equipped. Unlike the medkit, SCP-500 cannot be cancelled anytime during use. Since it is an SCP, it will only count towards your SCP item slots making it even more limited as humans cannot carry more than 2 SCP items.


**Approachable PlayStyles:**

| A Quick-Fix

| Combat Advantage
Since it has regenerative properties. Using 500 right before a gunfight can give you the upper hand in health regen. Allowing you to survive more shots, you can fire back and in most cases win.
