### Gameplay:

**Detailed Gameplay Description:**

As a facility guard, you are the first line of defence for the SCP Foundation. Though hardly equipped to deal with the major threats of a security breach, your primary goal is to escort vital personnel to safety or to extraction, and to eliminate minor threats to the foundation's security until the MTF sends reinforcements to secure the facility. Scattered across the Entrance Zone, your only hope is to work together and follow your mission.

| Light Containment Zone
Entering Light Containment Zone is when your real mission begins. Search around this section for scientists as swiftly as possible as each second that passes is another second closer to danger. You will find many Class-D personnel in this zone, many of them being aggressive, a threat to either you or the scientists, and on rare occasions armed with weapons. Guards should only ever take one willing class-D to act as bait for SCPs, or as a sacrifice for the femur breaker in the event that SCP-106 is active in the round. Most Class-D should be dispatched of quickly as to prevent complications in the future. If you're lucky enough, you may find additional ammo in the lockers in unique rooms of Light Containment Zone, or on the corpses of Class-D that happened to be carrying some for ill-intent purposes.

Prioritising scientists, Facility Guards should make their way to the common place where scientists can be found, that being 914. Sometimes class-D can prove useful and guide you to 914, to which you should extract the scientists, and terminate any potential threats to their lives. You may come across scientists on your way to 914, who you should also guide to safety. Once you have found enough scientists, your team should focus on escorting them back to the Entrance Zone, or if an access card capable of opening the gates has been acquired, extracting the scientists.

| Heavy Containment Zone
Once in heavy containment, try to locate a small T-intersection armoury if you weren't able to find ammo in the lockers, as extra bullets may help in fending off SCPs that chase after you. If you have obtained a scientist Keycard, try locating SCP-096's room, as acquiring the sergeant's keycard from that room will prove useful in aiding the scientists. Vigilance is recommended as one wrong step you take may be your demise. Listen out for SCPs, as avoiding them is the best idea while you try and find an elevator up into light containment zone. Communicate with your fellow guards to keep them safe from danger, as sticking together may prevent SCPs such as 939 away from your group.

| Entrance Zone
At the beginning of the game, you will spawn in a random location in the entrance zone, along with other facility guards littered around nearby. Finding your fellow guards is key to surviving Heavy Containment Zone, and other guards should be encouraged to work as a team. Equipped with a radio, locating your allies is simple enough and intel should be shared as you never know what information could save your life, or theirs. Lockers are spread across the offices and contain a variety of useful items such as additional ammo, various medical supplies, and scientist keycards which can be useful in your mission. Being grouped is the best way to survive as a facility guard. Once you've grouped up, you're ready to head into heavy containment. Being cautious is recommended, as there are many undesirable threats that lurk beyond the checkpoint doors.

| Surface Zone
Guards should only go to surface zone for two reasons; if they are extracting scientists from the facility, or if the Alpha Warhead is about to detonate. They should then assist in securing an NTF win by any means necessary. Otherwise once the vital personnel are safely extracted, and your primary objective is completed. You must move onto the secondary objective of securing the foundation by recontaining the SCPs and terminating all threats to the foundation such as Class-D and Chaos Insurgents.

**Enemies/Allies:**

Your allies are Scientists and Nine-Tailed Fox.
You can assist the scientists by:
- Damaging/distracting SCPs
- Showing them the way out
- Eliminating all threats to them

You can assist the Nine-Tailed Fox by:
- Providing more units
- Having an upgraded card for them.
- Killing the Class-D and Chaos Insurgency
- Dealing as much damage to the SCPs.
- Arming the nuke to detonate the facility, limiting the playing area.
- Providing valuable intel about the inside of the foundation.

Your enemies are the SCPs, Class-D, and Chaos Insurgency. These teams will take any opportunity to kill your team and your allies as well as impede your progress in any way they can. These enemies must be terminated to secure an NTF Victory.

**Class Interactions**

| SCP-173 
Though an uncommon interaction, it's in your best interest to steer clear from 173 and not spend ammunition on the statue, as damaging it will only make it faster. This in turn would endanger your team, or any scientists you are escorting. Make sure to keep your eyes on it, as you will realistically only ever encounter the statue early in the game in the Light Containment Zone, which isn't a strong area for 173 as it is pretty wide and open.

| SCP-096
Unless you are equipped with a Micro H.I.D it is a terrible idea to face this SCP, as it usually ends up with 096 slaughtering the entire Facility Guard team without breaking a sweat. It is recommended to avoid this SCP as much as possible. Thanks to his passive crying, it's easy to locate it without ever needing to look at it.

| SCP-049 and SCP-049-2
The Plague Doctor shouldn't be too much of a threat as long as the Facility Guards stay in a large group, as 049 is quite fragile, meaning even the Guards could recontain him within the first few minutes of the round. The 'cured' on the other hand are a nightmare for Guards, as they consume the precious, limited ammo they have.

| SCP-106
As a Facility Guard, going up against 106 early in the game is a really bad idea because of his resistance to bullets. Shooting 106 won't bother him and may even encourage him to pursue you further. Guards that confront 106 at the start of the game frequently end up as pocket dimension food. Since this class is not well equipped for handling SCPs, SCP-106 should only be engaged once the correct equipment is obtained, such as several grenades or the Micro H.I.D. Thankfully guards are equipped with flash grenades that can be used to blind this SCP in the event it is standing at the checkpoint.

| SCP-939
Though this SCP will stray away from large groups of Facility Guards, being on your own is a different story, and makes you become perfect prey for a 939. If you are alone and believe a 939 is nearby, you should contact any teammates on the radio and have your med kit ready in your hand. 939 can appear from any corner if stealthy enough, and having a med kit ready will increase your survivability by allowing you to take another hit from 939 without dying. Try to run away from 939, closing doors behind you so that you gain distance away from the SCP until it has given up. This SCP should always be approached with a large group armed with guns.

| SCP-079
The Computer will be looking for easy kills to boost its access tier early in the game, unfortunately that makes you a huge opportunity for 079. Pay attention to the cameras, as they will glow blue if the computer is using it. It's best to assume your position is compromised once you've spotted 079, as it can see you just as well. Pay close attention to the cameras at the tesla gates, as 079 likes to sit at the tesla gates waiting for unsuspecting guards. The old guard saying for going through the tesla gate goes "If it's blue, don't go through, if it's red, then go ahead."

| Class-D Personnel
Class-D should be approached with caution, and should be terminated if showing signs of resistance, or if deemed a threat to scientists. If necessary, guards should only take one willing and cooperative Class-D to serve as bait for SCPs or as a sacrifice for SCP-106. Otherwise it is not beneficial to rescue Class-D personnel and must be terminated to secure the foundation.

| Scientists
Your main priority. Scientists are to be retrieved and escorted safely to the extraction zone or any safe location if extraction is impossible. Ensure Scientists stay alive at all costs until NTF arrive to extract them. Work with them and guide them to safety.

| Chaos Insurgency
This group is known for sabotaging and terrorizing the foundations operations, they will not hesitate to kill you or the scientists. Unfortunately due to their elusive nature, you won't be informed of their presence until your team spots them, or if you can hear their lethal logicers firing in the distance. In rare instances, a co-operative Class-D may inform you of their arrival, as they can hear when the Chaos Insurgency arrives. You must eliminate Chaos Insurgency on sight, and alert your team of their presence.

| Nine Tailed Fox
The NTF are your allies, easily discernible by their blue uniforms. It's advised that Facility Guards follow the instructions of the NTF, as they are their superiors. Assist them in any way you can by informing them of specific SCPs that are present, and where to find specific rooms in Heavy Containment Zone.

**Approachable PlayStyles:**

| The Enforcer
This PlayStyle focuses on killing all the Class-D personnel and leaving the scientists for later on. The Enforcer is all about ensuring there are no threats to the foundation by killing all non-essential personnel and spending ammunition just to hurt SCPs. The Enforcer doesn't care which SCP gets shot and will spend every last bullet on the SCPs once he is sure the Class-D are neutralised. Often viewed and portrayed as cruel and heartless, this playstyle is for those who don't want to take risks with the Class-D personnel, by terminating all the Class-D, The Enforcer ensures that no Class-D escape the facility. 

| NTF's Best Friend
Caring little for the Class-D, this playstyle offers a less bloodthirsty route, focusing on the mission rather than focusing on the threats. This Facility Guard will ensure that scientists get escorted out of Light Containment Zone, and will take steps to assist with 079's recontainment by obtaining the Sergeant's keycard for the sole purpose of activating generators, and opening gates for the scientists. These players will mainly spend their ammo on SCPs to keep them away from the scientists and will often sacrifice their own life to protect them.
