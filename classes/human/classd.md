**Description:** - *"Inmates kept within the bowels of the Foundation sites as lab rats; test subjects at the mercy of the Foundation’s cruel practices. Escape from your confines and rebel against your imprisoners — by any means necessary."*

Unfortunately for you, class Ds are almost everyone’s enemies. Keep that in mind… When near scientists, tread carefully, because if one of them has a weapon, they won’t hesitate to end you.

### Gameplay:

**Detailed Gameplay Description:**
Your main objective is to escape the facility by any means necessary. The moment you spawn you’re already fighting for survival, starting in the cell block alongside 40% of the players within the server. Firstly, you need to gain access to a keycard, but where do you find them? And what can you use to better help your escape?

| Light Containment Zone
When you first step out of your cell, you can either go with the main group which gives you protection but less item security, or split off your own way to find a keycard, which can be rewarding but also more dangerous. The easiest ways to get a keycard is to hang around 012 and wait for a scientist to open the door, or open random lockers as they can contain medical items, keycards and more. Whether you have something or nothing, you should then head to SCP-914 to pick up and upgrade your items. Be careful though.. The SCP’s first target is usually 914 so staying around for too long will most likely end with your untimely demise. I’d usually recommend getting a Facility Manager card as it allows you the freedoms that a lot of other cards can’t give you, along with the upgrade path being super simple so you can cut down on time. Make sure to tap sprint as much as you can to conserve stamina.

| Heavy Containment Zone
Once in Heavy, you should try to mostly avoid tesla gates. If you don’t time walking through them properly, they will immediately kill you and the sound is loud enough to alert all nearby players. Try to stick to open hallways and search for special rooms. You’ll notice that there are a lot less hiding spaces in heavy, so door frames are your friends. Arguably the most important room here is SCP-096’s containment chamber, as it contains a sergeants’s card inside (scientists card+ is needed to open the door). Remember to arm the nuke along the way.

| Entrance Zone
You should be getting more cautious now. Since a lot of time has most likely passed, either NTF or Chaos are getting ready to spawn if they haven’t already, and as a d-boi near the exit, many of them are most likely spectating you. Run. Run for the bomb shelter and hope for the best. If you hear NTF spawning, run and hide back in the Heavy Containment Zone and wait to be saved.

| Goal checklist
- Obtain a keycard and/or weapon.
- Locate SCP-914.
- Upgrade your keycard.
- Get to an elevator system to get into the HCZ.
- Find the entrance zone checkpoint and make your way to a gate.
- Take the elevator to the surface and escape into the bunker.

**Enemies/Allies:**

Your only ally is the Chaos Insurgency. NTF, Scientists, Guards and SCPs are your enemies and they will not let you survive.

The Chaos Insurgency spawn later on in the round in waves. They start off with 14 tickets, meaning 14 players spawn in the first wave unless altered. Their goals are to rescue class-d, kill ntf and wipe out the scientists and get a victory for the class-d.

Scientists are considered neutral, however they will not hesitate to turn on you if they gain access to weapons or no longer find you useful.

Finally, the MTF units are purely enemies. They have next to no reason to keep you alive besides bait for SCPs and as a sacrifice.

**Approachable PlayStyles:**

| Stealth
The Stealth strategy is based on barely being seen and minimizing risk. The first thing you want to do is not be in a group. Always keep your sprint just in case you need to run and if you know an SCP is near, hide and keep quiet. You want to stay back from 914 until you know the SCP’s are gone and pick up any items you can. The next part is the hardest part in this. You have to go into HCZ where SCP’s will probably be. You should avoid tesla’s as much as you can and always listen to your surroundings as the SCP’s make noise. If you get caught by an SCP, book it out of there and hide when you know you are safe. If you find EZ, go through but keep to the sides because the hallways are straight and there are limited hiding spaces. Find Gate A or B and go through the elevator. Hope nothing will spawn when you’re up there and escape!

| Group
The Group strategy is based on sticking with allies. Use your sprint to catch up with teammates to not be left behind. When traveling try to collect items before your allies can, items with healing properties will greatly benefit you. Find 914 and upgrade to at least Facility Manager or Senior Researcher, it is advisable to upgrade further, but either of these cards can get you out of Light. Stay with your group as you travel into heavy and run away if it means life or death, hopefully you can find another group to stick with. Find EZ, and keep in close proximity with others until you find Gate A or B. If something moves towards you and your group, you can escape while those ahead of you are captured.
