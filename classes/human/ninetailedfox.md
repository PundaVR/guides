**Detailed Gameplay Description:**

The NTF are the brawn of the SCP Foundation's security. Several platoons of highly trained, highly armed Nine-Tailed Fox soldiers are deployed throughout the round to regain control of the facility. Though squad spawn size varies, there is always one captain and at least one sergeant. The objectives of these soldiers are: to deploy into the underground facility to recontain all of the escaped SCPs, eliminate all threats to the foundation's security, and to escort scientists or higher tier staff to the extraction zone outside the facility. Although outfitted with several items to help with their objectives, they can utilise many other items within the facility to further assist them with their mission. These soldiers will require a lot of teamwork to complete objectives, as a lone wolf will struggle to complete the objectives efficiently or sufficiently.

These soldiers are outfitted with the Epsilon 11 rifle for captains and sergeants, designed to deal with targets at both close distances and long distances with high efficiency; and the crossvec for the Cadets, which are effective at dealing high amounts of damage at close to mid range of their target. These weapons are customizable to suit the users needs for the situation. In addition to these guns, these soldiers are also given frag grenades to assist with recontaining SCPs or as a temporary area denial. Every unit is given a radio to give intel over long distances as well as an access card respective to their rank.

| Light Containment Zone
This is the last place the Nine-Tailed Fox would search, as by the time units have made their way to light containment zone, decontamination has commenced or is about to. This zone is only entered if a unit wanted to upgrade their equipment with SCP-914 or has just escaped SCP-106's Pocket Dimension and was teleported to either PC-15 or an X-Intersection.

| Heavy Containment Zone
This is the zone where Nine-Tailed Fox operatives will spend the most time, as most vital personnel that remain will be in this zone awaiting extraction with the NTF or hiding away from the SCP Dangers until the NTF are able to safely escort them. Heavy Containment zone is also home to SCPs as they will find Heavy Containment Zone to be the most beneficial because of the close-quarter nature of the area. This makes teamwork vital for this segment, as separating or splitting up often results in units being disposed of very quickly. Heavy Containment zone holds a lot of useful items that will assist them in their mission to recontain the escaped SCPs.

These items include: SCP-268, SCP-207, SCP-018 and SCP-500. There are also certain rooms in Heavy Containment Zone that are of great interest to the NTF, including a T-intersection Armory filled with ammunition in the event units run out during the mission, 2 additional armory rooms inside SCP-049's Chambers, or the Alpha Warhead Control Room. Either of these small armory rooms hold an Epsilon 11 rifle with ammo for the weapon, whereas the other will contain a surplus of various supplies and ammo in small cubic compartments.

This Zone also contains the very powerful Micro H.I.D, which is especially useful for assisting the NTF in their objective to recontain SCPs. There is also the aforementioned Alpha Warhead Control Room, which has an additional armory as well as the control panel for the Alpha Warhead. The panel has two interactive objects, a red button that cancels the detonation sequence and a lever that arms and disarms the warhead. The detonation sequence does not initiate in the control room, but rather in the Warhead Remote Access room on the Surface Zone. The team should only attempt to detonate the Alpha Warhead if no other method of recontaining SCPs has succeeded as the explosion will destroy the underground facility entirely as well as everything and everyone that hasn't evacuated.

| Entrance Zone
Entrance Zone is where the NTF first begin their mission. They should devote a bit of time to search this zone before advancing, keeping an eye out for SCPs that are plotting an ambush, or for any threats to the foundation to neutralise, as well as searching each room in this zone for any essential personnel that are hiding and awaiting extraction.

This zone is when the team should be on high alert, as majority of gunfights between Chaos Insurgency and the Nine-Tailed Fox occur in Entrance Zone and Heavy Containment Zone. Listening for specific sounds, as well as giving/receiving intel over the radio can also be extremely useful. Additionally, NTF Captains can access the intercom room to broadcast a message to everyone in the game, though the broadcaster has to be careful not to share vital information to their enemies if they intend to inform other units without radios of plans/details about the mission objectives.

| Surface Zone
Surface Zone is where the NTF are initially deployed. The helicopter will land at the facility and respawn up to 20 NTF, though number of NTF spawned is dependent on how many spectators there are and how many spawn tickets they have remaining. Once deployed, if the facility is still operational, the task force should make their way to the Gate B Elevator which is located at the end of the right side catwalk. Once they enter the elevator and make their way down into the facility, they should be wary of surprise attacks they might encounter once the doors open back up. 

If already opened by someone, there is a small room at the bottom of Gate A's stairs that initiates the detonation sequence for the Alpha Warhead. Keep in mind that only 3 keycards can access the Detonation Sequence Initiation room, that being the Containment Engineer, the Facility Manager, and the O5 Card. No access card is required to disarm/arm the warhead within heavy containment zone and it can be disarmed or cancelled by every class. Note that cancelling the detonation sequence rounds the remaining time to the closest multiple of 5. Keep this in mind when heading back down into the facility to re-arm the warhead.

The detonantion room on the surface can also act as a sort of safe room from most threats aside from 106, an enraged 096, or an enemy with a high enough level access card to get into the room. This can be effective against a freshly spawned wave of Chaos Insurgents as they will not spawn with a card that has access to the small room, and units can wait for them to get bored before leaving the room to continuing with the mission. Although this not effective once the warhead detonates, as all doors will be forced open.

Fighting against the Chaos on the surface can be a little tedious at times, although the NTF spawn point has a height and distance advantage, allowing for more planning time and the ability to pick Chaos off from a distance.

**Enemies/Allies:**

The Allies of the NTF are the Scientists, Facility Guards, and survivors from previous NTF spawn waves.
You can assist Scientists by:
Neutralising any threat that endangers the Scientist's life.
Escorting the Scientist to the Extraction Zone on the surface.
Staying close to Scientists and giving them medkits when they need it.

NTF should encourage Facility Guards to assist them in the mission as you both share the same goals, be sure to keep an eye out for remaining survivors of previous spawns as they will be helpful in recontaining SCPs, activating generators, or getting into gunfights with enemies. Previous Survivors as well as Facility Guards may have more knowledge of the facility due to having been inside the facility for longer, this information will be useful in completing objectives and should encourage the team to seek out these survivors and guards.

The enemies of the NTF include: Class-D Personnel, Chaos Insurgency, and SCPs. These teams will actively try to eliminate Scientists and fellow NTF and must be neutralised to secure an NTF Victory.

**Class Interactions**

| SCP-173
When encountering SCP-173, it's important to both keep your distance and an eye on the sculpture. Its monstrous 3200 HP might sound overwhelming and impossible to take on, but it becomes manageable once you have other players around to help, taking advantage of its limited mobility. When by itself, SCP-173 isn't really that threatening and can be easily dispatched of with simple teamwork and communication. Keeping tabs on 173 is recommended as it will try to make use of blind spots. A good 173 will never confront you head on unless it has another SCP with it, or you are on your own. 173 plays a unique sound of concrete dragging on the ground as it approaches you, though if the statue is damaged, hearing that sound may mean it is too late. Always be wary of this SCP, as it uses your confidence and inattentiveness as a weapon.

| SCP-096
SCP-096 is an extremely lethal SCP and is the common reason why NTF squads get wiped out. If the creatures face appears anywhere in your line of sight, even in the deep fog, you become a target and its AHP increases by 70. When on your own, you won't stand a chance against a full HP SCP-096 and should be advised to keep your head down to avoid triggering its enraged state. You can stay close by as when it exits the enraged state, it will be on a temporary cooldown where you can get a full clip into it without it being enraged or using the Micro H.I.D.

| SCP-049 and SCP-049-2
The Plague Doctor is no laughing matter. Although fragile, he is still a big threat to NTF. A clever 049 will never charge the NTF directly, but will rather use the close quarters to its advantage. The Doctor can resurrect recently killed humans to serve as diversions, direct damage, or as bullet sponges for the more valuable SCPs. Though dangerous and with a lethal touch, the Plague Doctor is slow and can be easily avoided. Keeping tabs on 049 is vital for taking him down as losing track of the Doctor means he can pop out from anywhere. Dealing with 049 is simple enough, a group of 3 NTF keeping their distance from each other and the Plague Doctor means that at least one NTF will be able to shoot the SCP while also keeping him on his toes. SCP-049 will utilise corners to avoid being lured, to which NTF will need to throw grenades to force him out of these corners and into open fire.

Handling SCP-049-2 can be more challenging, as they exist to purely waste ammo and medical supplies. Being nearly as fast as a sprinting human means that simply running away from the 'cured' isn't going to be enough. A major weakness 049-2 has is that it's the only SCP that has a headshot vulnerability. With the limited 300 HP, it won't need a lot of headshots to take down a single one. However, 049-2's strength doesn't come from single numbers but rather from a horde. Many zombies will easily overwhelm you and your team and the easiest way to deal with a large swarm of these SCPs is with a couple of grenades, as they may not be able to hear it over the many loud footsteps of their own group. Grenades will be enough to diminish the horde's size to a manageable amount.

| SCP-106
One of the tankiest SCPs, taking only 2 damage per bullet means that shooting this guy to death is going to be very hard with his 650 HP. If you're on your own, your best bet is avoid 106 and to run away if he spots you. 106 is faster than a walking human and can walk through gates and doors making him one of the hardest SCPs to shake off your tail. His attack isn't an instakill as long as the warhead hasn't gone off. His loud footsteps makes it easier to hear him before he spots you. 106 has two huge flaws, those being his vulnerability to every non-bullet source of damage, as well as the femur breaker which requires as little as 2 people to activate. An access card with containment level 3 can enter the femur breaker room, though one player needs to step into the small box located on the back middle of the room to prime the femur breaker. Once the player enters, the door for that small box will close, killing the player instantly. All that's left to do is press the large red button. You will still need to avoid 106 until C.A.S.S.I.E announces his recontainment. Alternatively, it's possible to brute force 106 with a large 15-20 man squad firing upon 106, though this will result in the squad having no more ammo to fight the other SCPs.

| SCP-939
An elusive SCP. A clever 939 will rarely show itself to the NTF as it is nearly as fragile as 049 but minus the slow speed. This SCP will use Heavy Containment Zone followed by its silent footsteps to catch stray NTF and eliminate them. With the sprint speed of 939 being slightly slower than a human's sprint speed, 939 can relocate to a different position easily if found out. Once bitten by this SCP, the amnesia debuff will be applied to you for a couple of seconds, blinding you and making you unable to switch items in your inventory or reload your weapon. The easiest way to handle 939 is to charge it with a large group, chase them down but also maintain a safe distance from its attack. A group of 5-7 should be enough to easily take down 939.

| SCP-079
The computer is unique in that it isn't killable with weapons and can only be recontained by activating 5 generators scattered across the Heavy Containment Zone. Since 079 is considered an extremely valuable ally to the SCPs, the only other way to recontain 079 is by recontaining all other SCP subjects, which will cause C.A.S.S.I.E to initiate 079's recontainment sequence automatically. Be mindful as the computer can black out rooms to make 173 more aggressive, or lock doors to trap you in a room full of SCPs. In addition to this, the computer can activate tesla gates in between the cooldown times to kill any unweary humans.

**Approachable PlayStyles:**

| Private
The main bulk of the NTF, the Private comes equipped with the Crossvec, commonly mistaken as 'expendable' because of their access card's inability to open gates, high quantity and lower health values than their superiors. The Private is as valuable as any other rank and should not be taken lightly. With high numbers comes high firepower, and these members should use that to their advantage. Sticking closeby and using the power of many crossvecs can create a wall of bullets that SCPs will have to endure to get close. Thanks to the Crossvec's shredding power at close to mid range, Privates can also flank and get close and personal with the SCPs to maximise their damage. Getting too overzealous is a major weakness for the Private, as their HP doesn't support getting too close.

| Sergeant 
As the rank above Private, the Sergeant's slightly larger health pool offers better survivability, but limited numbers makes the Sergeant unable to replicate the Private's more assertive playstyle. Being equipped with the FR-SR, its effective range is from mid to long range. Sergeants should find themselves behind frontline Privates, picking off targets that are out of reach from Privates. Their access card allows gates to be opened, and thus Sergeants should lead Privates towards objectives will eliminating threats. Keen eyes and ears as well as fluent communication is vital for the Sergeant as this will keep both him and his team alive.

| Specialist
Scientists that escape the facility and are extracted become NTF Specialists. The Specialist should behave similarly to the Sergeant, having the same access level of a Sergeant makes them able to access gates as well. Equipped with the FR-SR, Specialists should play a little bit conservatively, as their intel of the inside of the facility is vital to the team. These guys should be the ones to navigate the team safely throughout the facility as well as assiting the team from the backlines by either laying down fire support, or throwing grenades from the back towards enemies.

| Captain
The Captain is the most crucial rank, having the highest health pool and the highest access card of the team makes it only one Captain being able to spawn in a single wave. Outlining the importance of the Captain, his role is to provide orders, keep the team in check and grant access to locations that only his keycard can access. Being equipped with the FR-SR, he should support his team from the very backlines, as putting his life in danger may put the team in jeopardy.
