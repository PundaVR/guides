### Gameplay:

**Detailed Gameplay Description:**

Your main objective is to escape the facility using the items given to your class as an advantage. As well as all the fights against SCPs, you’ll be fighting against class-d; the majority of players in the round. As a basic keycard has already been obtained, there's more incentive to upgrade your card and reach heavy early on.

| Light Containment Zone
Scientist keycards can open SCP-012’s containment cell, which will contain a Zone Manager card, and/or a gun. If found early, upgrading your card in SCP-914 is recommended, as it provides a great advantage, however beware of any class-d personnel, as they may be armed. Arming yourself is less necessary, as you have guards as allies. It may be more beneficial to find them in Heavy Containment than try to hang around light any more than needed.

| Heavy Containment Zone
Once you’re in heavy, you should try to avoid tesla gates, as they bring unwanted attention to your location. As you have likely gotten out of light quicker than class-d, SCPs will be near elevators, checkpoints or lurking around heavy. I’d recommend staying low, and avoiding any non-human footsteps. If you see any guard, stick close to them. Guards have come from the Entrance zone, and most likely know where it, and other important locations are. Notable locations for un-upgraded cards are SCP-096’s room and Nuke Room. SCP-096’s room contains a Lieutenant card, which can open gates, while Nuke Room contains a guard keycard on the shelves which can open checkpoint doors.

| EZ/SZ
Escaping provides the Nine Tailed Fox team with one spawn ticket, on servers where tickets are limited this can give your team an advantage. (Provided they are not cuffed, or any other server specific exception applies).

| Goal Checklist:
- Locate SCP-914.
- Upgrade your keycard.
- Find facility guards/NTF.
- Activate the nuke.
- Find the entrance zone checkpoint and make your way to a gate.
- Take the elevator to the surface and escape into the bunker.

**Enemies/Allies:**

Your allies are Nine Tailed Fox and the Facility Guards.
You can assist the facility guards by:
Opening 096’s containment
Leading them to 914 to upgrade their cards and kill the Class-D.

You can assist the Nine Tailed Fox by:
Escaping so they can win.
Having an upgraded card for them.
Killing the Class-D and Chaos Insurgency
Dealing as much damage as SCP’s.
Arming the nuke to explode the facility, limiting the playing area.

Class-D, Chaos Insurgency and SCP’s are your enemies and they’ll attempt to kill you if they can.

**Approachable PlayStyles:**

Speedrun
The Speedrun strategy is based on escaping as fast as you can. The first thing you want to do is find SCP-012’s containment chamber. Open the door to the chamber and get the zone manager and sometimes the gun. Use your sprint to walk around faster. Find Exit A or B to leave light containment zone. Once you’re in heavy containment zone, try and find 096’s containment room as fast as you can. Once you’ve found it you should get the lieutenant card and run around and find the entrance zone checkpoint. When you’ve found it, go through and find gate A or B, preferably B as it reduces the amount you need to walk. Go down the elevator and head to the escape zone. Don’t worry about something spawning because if you’re quick, nothing will spawn for the next minute or two. Once you’ve escaped see what time you got and if it’s below 3 minutes you get an achievement. Then flex how easy this game is.

Stealth
This Stealth strategy is based on barely being noticed and ensuring your safety. Once you have spawned you should immediately hide next to the checkpoint. Wait until an SCP opens the checkpoint and passes you then slowly sneak past them. Head into the elevator and up into heavy. This strategy is even better due to facility guards being your allies, and if they open the gates instead they won’t kill you.
