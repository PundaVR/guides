### Gameplay:

**Detailed Gameplay Description:**

| Docile
The first thing you'll notice about 096 is the fact that there are two health bars. HP and AHP (hume shield). The HP starts at 1500 and the hume shield at 350 (sometimes glitches and goes to 500). The hume shield is very special, as it passively regenerates over time at a rate of 5 p/s after 10 seconds of not taking damage. 096 has one special ability when docile. It is able to lean or doors and gates, almost entirely silencing 096's cries. However, the ripples in the air from the hume shield can be seen through some doors, and you can't move or turn when leaning against it. As of the Scopophobia update (24th of July 2020), it will trigger as soon as its face is viewed. This means that players looking straight down or at 096's back won't trigger it.
Note: To lean on the doors in entrance zone, you need to look at the solid part, as the windows aren't counted as an interactive area.

| Enraged
It becomes enraged whenever anyone views its face. During the enraging period, 096 moves even slower (3 m/s). The time it takes to fully rage depends on how far away the targets are (the further away, the longer it takes). The base rage time for 096 is 15 seconds, with another 3 seconds added on for each person that looks at it. This value is capped at 30 seconds, but is still subject to change. On top of adding another 3 seconds to the rage timer, each target that views 096s face or shoots it, will add another 70ahp to the hume shield (anything above base hume will vanish once 096 unrages). The final thing that happens when 096 is enraged,is all non-targets become invisible, with targets being highlighted with large, glowing red orbs which can be seen through walls (SCP-287 will have no affect). Finally, 096's speed massively increases and it can jump very high.

| Active Abilities
Now for the active abilities. The first and most obvious is the AOE attack. When left clicking, 096's arm will swing, damaging everyone in range and instantly killing whoever is in front of it. 096 can hit "invisible" players. This attack will destroy doors, and doors will be prioritised above players, meaning some will try to avoid 096's attacks that way. If you have an 079, try to be careful not to destroy them all. The next ability is 096's charge. Activated on a right click, this will more than double it's movement speed, destroy any doors in it's path and slaughter anyone in a small bubble around it. Hitting a person or wall will instantly cancel 096's charge however. There is a small indicator at the bottom of the screen that shows your charge cooldown. If 096 charges at a closed gate, or right clicks while enraged near it, 096 will temporarily force gates open, allowing SCPs to pass through (it will instantly kill any humans).

Overall, SCP-096's biggest strength is people's inability to act in time, or complete fear once you're enraged, as most people will try to sand still or simply run away. It's best to take advantage of that, and make sure everyone in the room is terrified of what you might do. 096 is one of the most powerful SCPs in the game, and is the only one capable of holding its own against multiple waves of chaos and NTF.

| Light Containment Zone
The light containment zone is a great one for playing as SCP-096. As mentioned on several of the other SCP's pages it is very maze-like, and as such, can be extremely useful. Since most of the people down in light containment will have very few items, they have nowhere to run and nowhere to hide. If you're alone, one of 096's biggest weaknesses will begin to show. While the layout is quite beneficial for you, the lack of of obstacles and environmental hazards allows people to just look down and walk away in most cases.

| Heavy Containment Zone
If played right, a lone 096 will be able to wipe out almost anything that's thrown at it in the heavy containment zone The sharp corners make is really easy to avoid grenades, SCP-018 and more whilst having very limited hiding spaces and long stretches of halls. Once triggered, you should be able to blindly swing down hallways, killing everyone that looked at you. Keep in mind that reinforced doors for areas such as SCP-106's containment cell and checkpoints require three hits to destroy, which will eat into your rage time.

| Entrance Zone
The majority of map layouts for the entrance zone are long stretches of hallways, which allow you to just charge in a straight line and kill everything in your path. This should in theory make it the best area to fight, but this isn't actually the case. NTF, Chaos, or other human classes are able to shoot through open doorways and guarantee hitting you, meaning that strafing is key.

| Surface Zone

**Approachable PlayStyles:**

| Defensive
A good way to play 096 is to play defensively and carefully. With your slow speed, you won't be able to carry out an offensive. Try and get in a position which would force enemies to look at you.

| Teaming up
As said in 173's description, teaming up with 173 is a good way to make yourself way bigger of a threat. On the other hand, you could stick close to other SCPs.
