### Gameplay:

**Detailed Gameplay Description:**
You are the Sculpture, a fast-paced SCP built to support your team. Your ludicrous speed makes you the most capable in chasing down targets and repositioning with ease. You are not without weakness, you aren't able to move while in direct line of sight and must wait for humans to blink. Despite this flaw, you can travel large distances (proportional to your remaining HP) during a blink and can use this opportunity to snap the necks of humans that get too close to you. This effectively creates an active area denial around 173 while being looked at. Your objective is to prevent any escapes by killing all other teams. By needing to be looked at to prevent a kill, the sculpture can create deadly chemistry with other SCPs. 

| Light Containment Zone
As the only SCP that spawns in Light Containment Zone, you are the closest to the Class-D and Science Personnel. You start off the round in PT00 with a large door that's initially locked. Once unlocked, you should focus on picking off any humans early on in the round. They can be found en route to SCP-914 or to unique rooms that contain keycards or the COM-15. Due to the labyrinthian layouts of this section, it is quite easy to sneak up behind someone and kill them before anyone else notices. It's best to clear out the common rooms, do a few laps, and then head into the heavy containment zone.

| Heavy Containment Zone
Heavy Containment Zone is an entirely different ball game. Most of the level is compiled of long hallways and sudden turns which can make for very easy kills and getaways. One of the biggest hazards of this zone are the tesla gates, which can kill you in as few as 5 charges from full health. When passing through them, be aware that a human looking at you is enough to trap you. By this point, you should be grouping up and communicating with your team about strategies as well as locations of targets. Each SCP has their own downside which makes combining them significantly more difficult for humans to take advantage of them. Due to the nature of 173s movement, a small NTF wave can wipe you out in a matter of seconds. Chaos Insurgency can also pose a significant threat, but their goals make them less likely to attack you unless provoked. 

| Entrance Zone/Surface Zone
Due to the mostly open nature of these zones, they should be avoided at all costs. This zone is a series of long corridors for the most part. There are specific rooms that you can hide in such as the end rooms or the evacuation shelter, however, these rooms come with risk as getting caught in these hiding places can result in being overwhelmed by opposing factions. As 173, you are the least viable class to survive on the surface leaving you completely exposed in the majority of places. However, camping an elevator or hiding around a corner to catch unsuspecting enemies off-guard can prove useful.

**Class Interactions**

| SCP-096
The Shy Guy and The Sculpture create an outstanding team as they create the paradox of needing to look at and away from them at the same time. If they look at the you, then 096 will be triggered. If they don't look at you, you are free to snap their necks. Targets that try looking down at a 45 degree angle limit their view on their surroundings to which you should use to move about unpredictably to confuse them.

| SCP-049
Contrary to popular belief, you make great chemistry with the Plague Doctor. Thanks to your movement mechanics, simply existing in the area near targets spikes fear and forces them to look in your general direction. This allows 049 to move freely without being spotted or injured and picking off unsuspecting targets.

| SCP-939
939's vision improves your ability to position tactically as it can see through walls and feed you information on where targets will be coming from. Since you are far better equipped to chase down targets and close distances, you can team up with 939 to gain his intel and use it to kill targets you didn't even know were there.

| SCP-079
The Computer has an ability that coincides with your movement; the blackout ability. Once it reaches the second access tier, 079 gains the ability to shut off the lights in the room of any zone bar the surface. Any humans in a blacked out room aren't able to 'see' making them easy targets. The computer can also call out humans from anywhere in the map and can give detailed directions to them. Since you are the fastest SCP on average, you're able to cost 079 the least amount of auxiliary power by reaching the target that it would have likely trapped with locked doors the quickest.

**Approachable PlayStyles:**

| Sneaky sneaky!
As SCP-173, you'll most likely want to be sneaky and remain out of sight, as being looked at renders you entirely powerless in many situations. For this playstyle to work, you must have a basic understand of positioning and game sense to predict where targets will be and act accordingly. This can also work with hiding behind doors, waiting inside elevators, and moving up the raised sides of heavy containment. Rooms such as servers, airlocks and elevated offices are perfect hiding spots for 173.

| Corner hugging
Due to the way line of sight is calculated in game via the torso, you can sometimes move whilst being observed as SCP-173. The most common and effective way to utilise this is by hugging rounded corners, standing behind tables, and making sure door-frames come between you and the other humans. You can either wait to get the jump on someone, or to make up lost ground when chasing a target.
