### Gameplay:

**Detailed Gameplay Description:**
Your objective as SCP-173 is to kill all humans and support your fellow SCPs. With such unique sight-based mechanics, 173 meshes very well with several of the other SCPs in game, which can massively help your team.

| Light Containment Zone
SCP-173 is a statue made of concrete and rebar. Because it spawns in the light containment zone, it will almost certainly be the first SCP to face any of the human classes. You start off the round in [DETAILS ABOUT NEW 173 SPAWN HERE]. When you go into into light containment, your first priority should be to track down either the class-d spawn area or SCP-914, as these are the two most common places for people to be early on in the round. SCP-173 has the most unique movement mechanics in the game so far. Once you encounter a human class, you may notice that you can't move for multiple seconds at a time. This is because 173 actually has two sets of movement mechanics. The first is standard motion, allowing you to move around at high speeds proportional to your health (lower HP making 173 faster), but the second takes effect once observed by a human class. In-game, there is a blinking system where if a 173 is nearby, all human classes will keep their eyes open for 3 seconds and then blink for 1 second simletaneously. When not in a direct line of site, or when humans are blinking, 173 is able to teleport short distances to snap the neck of its victims. This movement does travel in a full 360 degrees, so it is possible to snap the necks of people up on ledges too. Due to the maze-like layouts of LCZ, it is usually quite easy to sneak up behind someone and kill them before anyone else notices. Usually it's best to clear out the common rooms, do a few laps, and then head into the heavy containment zone.

| Heavy Containment Zone
The playstyle in the heavy containment zone is surprisingly different. As most of the section is comprised of long hallways and sudden turns, it can be very easy to kill enemies or be evaded. One of the biggest hazards of this zone are the tesla gates, which can kill you in as few as 5 charges from full health. When passing through them, be aware that a human looking at you is enough to trap you. By this point, your best chances of survival come from grouping up with any other SCPs you can find. Due to the nature of 173s movement, a small NTF wave can wipe you out in a matter of seconds. Chaos Insurgency can also pose a significant threat, but due to the nature of their goals are more likely to avoid you than engage in combat. Tight spaces are your friend, and with SCP-079's room blackout ability being at its most effective in HCZ, you should make for a nearly unstoppable killing machine if played right. As mentioned before, the speed of 173 is directly proportional to its health, starting at 12.5m/s and ramping up to 20m/s. In the event that not many people remain and survival is a certainty, you can actually utilise the damage from a tesla gate to boost your speed significantly.

| Entrance Zone/Surface Zone
Due to the open nature of these zones, they should be avoided at all costs. Entrance zone is a series of long 2 way coridoors for the most part, allowing any opposing team to group up and shoot you, whilst the surface zone leaves you completely exposed in the majority of places. However, camping an elevator or hiding around a corner to catch unsuspecting enemies off-guard can prove useful.

**Approachable PlayStyles:**

| Sneaky sneaky!
As SCP-173, you'll most likely want to be sneaky and remain out of sight, as being looked at renders you entirely powerless in many situations. For this playstyle to work, you must have a basic understand of positioning and gamesense to guess where other people will be and sneak up from behind. This can also work with hiding behind doors, waiting inside elevators, and moving up the raised sides of heavy containment.

| Corner hugging
Due to the way line of sight is calculated in game via the hips, you can sometimes move whilst being observed as SCP-173. The most common and effective way to utilise this is by hugging rounded corners, standing behind tables, and making sure door-frames come between you and the other humans. You can either wait to get the jump on someone, or to make up lost ground when chasing a target.

| Teaming up
As mentioned in the main gameplay section, SCP-173 can be lethal when paired up with the right SCPs. One of the most feared and lethal combinations is 173 + 096. 173 is able to move and kill when not being looked at, but 096 becomes enraged and more powerful when observed. Any nearby humans will have to juggle maintaining eye-contact with you, whilst also avoiding looking at the face of SCP-096. The other powerful combination of SCPs is 173 + 079. One of the biggest disadvantages of 173 at high health is the fact that people can simply walk away while looking at you. SCP-079 can counter this by closing and locking doors, guiding you to a dead-end, or even blacking out rooms. Blacked out rooms allow you full freedom of movement so long as no other players have torches equipped.
