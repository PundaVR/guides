### Gameplay:

**Detailed Gameplay Description:**

SCP-079 is a sentient A.I that has access to most of the facility's hardware and monitoring systems. With these systems under 079's control, it makes it one of the hardest SCPs and sometimes the hardest SCP to counter and defeat if controlled by a experience 079 player. 079 starts off weak with little power generation per second (1.2AP/s) but with every tier that 079 increases, its power generation increases as well. At max tier (tier 5) 079 generates a base speed of 11.2 AP/s, almost 10x the amount per second from tier 1. This can be increased further by turning on generators around the facility which will be explained in further detail later in the guide.

| SCP-079 has a wide range of abilities, from controling doors to activating tesla gates. The full list of it's abilities goes as follows:
- Opening/Closing Doors
- Locking Doors
- Blackout (Locks all doors and turns the lights off in a room, this is excellent if SCP-173 has breached containment) as SCP-173 can kill everyone in that room instantly unless they have a flashlight)
- Sending Elevators up and down
- Speaker System (Some rooms have a speaker which 079 can use to talk to people in that room)
- 
| SCP-079 AP Generation and Tiers:
This is one of the more complex parts of SCP-079, so it will be quite long. Because SCP-079 interacts with the facility differently to the rest of the SCPs, as it uses AP (Auxillary Power) to jump from cameras and interact with doors and such around the facililty.
There are two ways to increase power generation. The first being increasing your tier, starting at tier 1 your power generates at a slow 1.2AP/s, by interacting with things like doors, you can get a small amount of experience, but if you assist in getting a kill, such as locking the door on a Scientist and letting an SCP kill them. This will give you 60 experience. Killing 2 scientists is enough to get you to tier 2. Every tier you go up increases your AP generation per second, but also increases the required experiece to get to the next tier as well as decreasing the experience earned for general interactions (closing/opening doors, moving elevators). A full list of experience required to increase tier is as follows; 100, 1XX, 1XX, 1XX, 200 in that order, every time 079's tier increases, the experience resets. Once hitting tier 5 (requires 200 experience), you can no longer increase tier thus cannot get anymore experience. Once you hit tier 5, you make a base speed of 11.2AP/s which is fast, but wait. There's more. You can increase your AP generation even further using Generators. There are 5 generators located around the facility, if all 5 are turned on (by placing a weapon Weapon Manager Tablet and keeping it inside the Generator for 60 seconds) 079 Will overcharge and be recontained, but for every generator that is turned on, SCP-079 makes more power a second. So if you can manage to have 3 or 4 generators active and make sure the 5th generator isn't activated. You can generate AP insanely fast. A full table of AP generation per tier:
```
              Tier 1      Tier 2      Tier 3      Tier 4      Tier5
0 Generators  1.200 AP/s  2.500 AP/s  4.100 AP/s  6.800 AP/s  11.2 AP/s
1 Generators  1.440 AP/s  3.000 AP/s  4.920 AP/s  8.160 AP/s  13.44 AP/s
2 Generators  1.740 AP/s  3.625 AP/s  5.945 AP/s  9.860 AP/s  16.24 AP/s
3 Generators  2.460 AP/s  5.125 AP/s  8.405 AP/s  13.94 AP/s  22.96 AP/s
4 Generators  3.420 AP/s  7.125 AP/s  11.685 AP/s 19.38 AP/s  31.92 AP/s
5 Generators  6.120 AP/s  12.75 AP/s  20.91 AP/s  34.68 AP/s  57.12 AP/s

| Light Containment Zone
One of the main places 079 can get experience to climb the tiers early game. Using the map feature (by pressing TAB) 079 can guide SCPs to SCP-914, a common place for many scientists and D-Class to be in the early game. Once at SCP-914, 079 can open the large gate, letting in the SCPs to massacre everyone inside. Just make sure to lock the door behind them as this will give you Experience (which you need to increase your tier). If done right you can usually hit tier 3 or even 4 depending on the amount of people inside 914.
In the case that SCP-173 is in the game, sending 173 to 914 is an effective strategy, as when 079 gets to tier 2 it gets the ability to blackout rooms, turning the lights off and locking all doors in that room for a brief period of time, making it a killzone if 173 is present, which speeds up the process and guarantees the experience for all kills.
Besdies the massacare of 914, SCP-079 doesn't have much use in Light Containment except for locking doors on unsuspecting people allowing SCPs to catch up with them and opening rooms like SCP-012, 914 and the Armoury for SCPs to enter as they cannot get access without a keycard.
