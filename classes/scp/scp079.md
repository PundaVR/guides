### Gameplay:

**Detailed Gameplay Description:**

SCP-079 is a sentient A.I that has access to most of the facility's hardware and monitoring systems. With these systems under 079's control, it makes it one of the hardest SCPs and sometimes the hardest SCP to counter and defeat if controlled by a experience 079 player. 079 starts off weak with little power generation per second (1.2AP/s) but with every tier that 079 increases, its power generation increases as well. At max tier (tier 5) 079 generates 11.2 AP/s, almost 10x the amount per second from tier 1. This can be increased further by turning on generators around the facility. There are 5 generators located around the facility, if all 5 are turned on (by placing a weapon Weapon Manager Tablet and keeping it inside the Generator for 60 seconds) 079 Will overcharge and be recontained, but for every generator that is turned on, SCP-079 makes more power a second. A tier 5 079 with 3 Generators makes 22.96 AP/s which is over double compared to no generators active at tier 5. So it is important to keep a balance of generators as SCP-079. The more generators, the faster the power generation but the easier it is to recontain 079.

| SCP-079 has a wide range of abilities, from controling doors to activating tesla gates. The full list of it's abilities goes as follows:
- Opening/Closing Doors
- Locking Doors
- Blackout (Locks all doors and turns the lights off in a room, this is excellent if SCP-173 has breached containment) as SCP-173 can kill everyone in that room instantly unless they have a flashlight)
- Sending Elevators up and down
- Speaker System (Some rooms have a speaker which 079 can use to talk to people in that room)

| Light Containment Zone
One of the main places 079 can get experience to climb the tiers early game. Using the map feature (by pressing TAB) 079 can guide SCPs to SCP-914, a common place for many scientists and D-Class to be in the early game. Once at SCP-914, 079 can open the large gate, letting in the SCPs to massacre everyone inside. Just make sure to lock the door behind them as this will give you Experience (which you need to increase your tier). If done right you can usually hit tier 3 or even 4 depending on the amount of people inside 914.
In the case that SCP-173 is in the game, sending 173 to 914 is an effective strategy, as when 079 gets to tier 2 it gets the ability to blackout rooms, turning the lights off and locking all doors in that room for a brief period of time, making it a killzone if 173 is present, which speeds up the process and guarantees the experience for all kills.
Besdies the massacare of 914, SCP-079 doesn't have much use in Light Containment except for locking doors on unsuspecting people allowing SCPs to catch up with them and opening rooms like SCP-012 and the Armoury for SCPs to enter.
