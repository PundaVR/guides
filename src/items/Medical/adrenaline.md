### Info:

**Spawn Location:**
**Healing:** 48hp + 30ahp
**Nickname/s:** Drugs, needle

### Gameplay:

**Detailed Description:**

The adrenalinject is a middle ground between the medkit and the pills in terms of healing. While it isnâ€™t as effective with recovering health, the ahp and stamina boost make it a must have either as a quick last resort, or to cover more ground without needing to stop for rests.

With the adrenaline equipped, left click to inject yourself. It gives an immediate 30ahp, which lasts 40 seconds (if you remain unharmed) and absorbs 70% of all damage taken until it is fully depleted. The normal health regeneration lasts 20 seconds, and heals a total of 48hp. Adrenaline has the added bonus of granting infinite stamina during the regeneration period, and removes the concussed status effect.
