# Adrenaline

**Name:** Adrenaline
**Description:** A nifty little health boost and last minute escape option.

### Info:

**Spawn Location:** Blue Wall-mounted Medkits that can spawn in both Light and Heavy Containment Zones. Standard lockers that can sometimes contain them.
**Healing:** Gives the player 40 Artificial Health Points
**Nickname/s:** Drug, Needle, Heroin

### Gameplay:

**Detailed Description:**

The adrenaline is a more supportive medical item due to its artificial health effect which combats the features of both the medkit and painkillers. While it isnâ€™t effective with recovering health, the artificial health points and stamina boost make it a must have either as a quick last resort, while in a chase, or to cover more ground without needing to stop for rests.
With the adrenaline equipped, left click to inject yourself. It gives an immediate 40 AHP, which lasts 35 seconds (if you remain unharmed) and absorbs 70% of all damage taken until it is fully depleted. Adrenaline has the added bonus of granting infinite stamina during the regeneration period, and removes the concussed status effect.
As a change in the recent Parabellum Update (v11.0), the adrenaline item no longer gives you a health regeneration effect.
