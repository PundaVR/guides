**Detailed Description:**

Painkillers are one of the weakest medical items in the game, but also quite powerful when used effectively. They’re a must have as almost any class, and are great at patching up small amounts of damage quickly.

Left click with painkillers equipped to use them. After 2.5 seconds you’ll regain 5hp, and then get 20 seconds of regeneration (heals at 2hp/s). Painkillers also remove the concussed and burned status effects, which serves to nullify the effects of explosions.
