### Gameplay:

**Detailed Description:**

A useful item in violent situations to heal up a lot of your health. It has advantages over using adrenaline and painkillers due to the amount that gets replenished in a short period of time. Its benefits come here as it is commonly found throughout the facility and can be carried up to 3 times without wearing any armour.

To use a medkit, you will need to Left-Click it while holding it. There is a 4 second delay before the medkit activates and it can be cancelled by pressing Right-Click within the first 3 seconds of activation. During use, the medkit will produce a sound which can be unideal in tense situations.
