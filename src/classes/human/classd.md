### Gameplay:

**Detailed Gameplay Description:**
Your main objective is to escape the facility by any means necessary. The moment you spawn you’re already fighting for survival since almost every other class is your enemy, starting in the cell block alongside 40% of the players within the server.
Firstly, you need to gain access to a keycard, but where do you find them? And what can you use to better help your escape?
Refer to the information below to get started.

*Light Containment Zone*
Upon exiting your cell, you can either follow other Class-D, which can give you protection but results in you not being able to get your own items, or alternatively go your own separate way to find your own items, which can sometimes be rewarding but also more dangerous.
The most common ways of obtaining a keycard is by making your way around Light Containment Zone in search of the key rooms that have loot. These are rooms labelled as:
- GR-18
- PC-15
- PT-00
- VT-00
- WC-00
All five of these rooms have a chance for either keycards and/or lockers (which contain keycards, medical and other general items) to spawn which can prove beneficial for Class-D. Another room that contains a keycard is #0-12, which is restricted to being accessed without a Scientist Keycard or higher (excluding the Zone Manager Keycard). Do note that you won't be able to open the door if you get trapped inside, even while being able to access to keycard at the bottom of the chamber since it is a Zone Manager Keycard.
Upon obtaining a keycard, you should make your way to the room #9-14 (also known as SCP-914). Using the keycard that you have obtained, you will be able to enter 914 and upgrade any items that you have with the respective settings, with it being preferable at upgrading on the Fine setting. Setting it to the wrong options could destroy or delay the upgrades of items that you have when entering the machine.
It is usually recommended to get a Facility Manager or 05 Keycard as it gives you the freedom that a lot of other cards cannot give you. After you have finished your upgrades, get ready to leave and make your way to an Elevator System (Ex-A or Ex-B), which will lead you up into Heavy Containment Zone.

*Heavy Containment Zone*
Once in Heavy Containment you should be cautious at all times due to the distinct nature of the zone. Unlike Light Containment Zone, there are no markings on or above any doors to guide you throughout the map, leaving you alone to explore and hope you find the way out.
Along with this, there is also the underlying issue of other SCPs and MTF scowering around which can be a big obstacle since it's not that easy to get around them.
In the event that you do not have items in this zone, there are a few locations where you can obtain items to progress to your escape.
Your first objective here would be to get to the Server Room where a Scientist Keycard is located on one of the two floors. Your next objective would to then get to SCP-096's Containment Chamber as it contains a Sergeant's Keycard inside, which has Gate access and can allow you to escape. Once you have this keycard, you will be able to access all items in the armouries located in SCP-049's Containment Chamber and in the Heavy Containment Zone's Nuke Silo, as well as SCP Items located in pedestals around Heavy Containment Zone.
Once you are prepared with enough gear, you should be able to get through Entrance Zone without needing to face as many obstacles.

*Entrance Zone*
Now that you are in Entrance Zone, the only objectives here are to find either Gate A or Gate B to lead you into Surface Zone. Although you are near the end of your journey, since a lot of time has most likely passed, either NTF or Chaos are getting ready to spawn if they have not already, and as a Class-D near the exit, many of them are most likely spectating you.
Due to this, it is important you quickly find either one of these rooms before a respawn, preferably Gate B since it is closer to the escape zone, because you may get unlucky and have NTF spawn over Chaos, delaying your escape and possibly resulting in your eventual termination.

**Enemies/Allies:**

Your only ally is the Chaos Insurgency. Nine-Tailed Fox, Scientists, Facility Guards and SCPs are your enemies and they will not let you survive.
Chaos Insurgency respawn later on in the round in waves. They start off with 14 tickets, meaning 14 players can spawn in the first wave unless altered. Their goals are to rescue Class-D, kill Nine-Tailed Fox and wipe out the Scientists to get a victory for the Class-D.
Scientists are considered neutral, however they will not hesitate to turn on you if they gain access to weapons or no longer find you useful.
Finally, Mobile Task Force units are purely enemies. They have next to no reason to keep you alive besides bait for SCPs and as a sacrifice for SCP-106.

**Class Interactions:**

Below are some interactions that you would most commonly see when encountering other classes as a Class-D:

*Scientists*
Interactions with Scientists begin in Light Containment Zone as they start here at the beginning of the round. Scientists will try to reach the same objective as you, which is to try and escape. During this process, they may try to:
- Kill you
- Steal items that you can use;
- And delay your escape through other means
Although they sometimes pose a threat, it is generally fine to trust them until you reach zones like Heavy Containment Zone, since they can rat you out to Facility Guards, or get you killed by SCPs.

*Nine-Tailed Fox*
Interactions with Nine-Tailed Fox usually occur later in the round after they have respawned, but it is not a guaranteed event that occurs as Chaos Insurgency can spawn instead.
In the event that a respawn does occur, they will not hesitate to shoot you or force you to sacrifice yourself to recontain SCP-106.

*Facility Guards*
Interactions with Facility Guards are mostly dependent on the type of player behind the class. Some players take a passive approach by disarming Class-D where they can, or alternatively just shoot every one of them that they can.

**Approachable PlayStyles:**

| Stealth
The Stealth strategy is based on barely being seen and minimizing risk. The first thing you want to do is not be in a group. Always keep your sprint just in case you need to run and if you know an SCP is near, hide and keep quiet. You want to stay back from 914 until you know the SCP’s are gone and pick up any items you can. The next part is the hardest part in this. You have to go into HCZ where SCP’s will probably be. You should avoid tesla’s as much as you can and always listen to your surroundings as the SCP’s make noise. If you get caught by an SCP, book it out of there and hide when you know you are safe. If you find EZ, go through but keep to the sides because the hallways are straight and there are limited hiding spaces. Find Gate A or B and go through the elevator. Hope nothing will spawn when you’re up there and escape!

| Group
The Group strategy is based on sticking with allies. Use your sprint to catch up with teammates to not be left behind. When traveling try to collect items before your allies can, items with healing properties will greatly benefit you. Find 914 and upgrade to at least Facility Manager or Senior Researcher, it is advisable to upgrade further, but either of these cards can get you out of Light. Stay with your group as you travel into heavy and run away if it means life or death, hopefully you can find another group to stick with. Find EZ, and keep in close proximity with others until you find Gate A or B. If something moves towards you and your group, you can escape while those ahead of you are captured.
