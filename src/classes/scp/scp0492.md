# SCP-049-2

**Name:** SCP-049-2
**Description:** "SCP-049-2 instances are reanimated corpses that have been operated on by SCP-049. These instances do not seem to retain any of their prior memories or mental functions, having only basic motor skills and response mechanisms. While these instances are generally inactive, moving very little and in a generally ambulatory fashion, they can become extremely aggressive if provoked, or if directed to by SCP-049. SCP-049-2 instances express active biological functions, though these are vastly different from currently understood human physiology. Despite these alterations, SCP-049 often remarks that the subjects have been "cured"."

### Gameplay:

**Detailed Gameplay Description:**

SCP-049-2 is a zombie created when 049 resurrects a dead player. They are definitely made for a more cooperative playstyle, favouring swarm tactics over most others. While they move faster than 049, -2s aren't the strongest, being limited to only a simple melee attack (40dmg). If shot in the head, zombies take a lot more damage, however, if shot in the arms or legs, the damage taken will be halved. This means that if played right, 049-2s can be very effective bullet sponges, capable of tanking a lot of damage for other SCPs.

In any zone, the best strategy is to stay close to other SCPs, stay constantly on the move, and always remain aware of your surroundings. Due to the attack windup for 049-2, it is a good idea to attack where you think a human will be rather than where they are.
