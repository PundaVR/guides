[Australia] Kitchen Island
Kitchen Island is a fun server anyone can join and mingle with the community in, whether you're here to play SCP:SL, Minecraft or make friends. We try to keep mature content to a minimum and aim for more of an 'everyone' experience. We are currently looking into expanding the games we have servers on such as Barotrauma and Project Zomboid, so if any of that interests you, swing by anytime.
