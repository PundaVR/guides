### Adding Content or Making Changes

You can make changes to this repo if you fork it then make a pull request with your changes. More info regarding how you can do this can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)

### What Info Should I Include?

Factual info with somewhat of a credible source. When making a pull request, we ask you to include sources at the bottom of the altered file, along with numbered tags referencing back to them (like this: `[1]: <link-to-source>`). Each tag should be incremented for each source.

If you do not wish to reference sources in the text file, you can just write it in the description of your pull request.


Another thing to note is that we prefer pull requests to be used only to add content or update inaccurate/outdated information. If you want to fix a typo in a file, please create an Issue on this repo instead.
